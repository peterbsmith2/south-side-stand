                  Plowshares Craftsfair and Peace Festival celebrates a world where people enjoy their work and have control over it. With 130 area craftspeople and community groups, it is a marketplace of ideas and beautifully diverse, hand made items. More than a craftsfair, it is a peace festival, with music, food and a spirit of fellowship, creating a weekend of grassroots commerce and community. It's a wonderful opportunity to connect at year's end with old and new friends and share in the life of a village marketplace that has no corporate headquarters. The Syracuse Peace Council's major fundraiser of the year, admission is sliding scale, $2-$5 (no one turned away for lack of funds) with under 16 and over 65 free.

                  Soft Spoken Band (SSB) will celebrate 35 years of performance excellence with a formal soulfood dinner buffet, cash bar and musical performance from 3 to 7 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 8, at Drumlins. The band will reminisce on its longtime history of showcasing the area's best musical talents by performing a set of favorites in a MASTER JAMS ensemble of past and present members. At the conclusion of the night bandleader Reggie Seigler will disassemble the Soft Spoken Band's institution as a longtime Syracuse based musical entity by publicly announcing the band's dissolution.

                  Over its 35 years the musicians and singers of SSB and the multiple musical seeds that have sprouted in its light have had the opportunity to perform before thousands both here at home and across the globe. "God has truly blessed our journey and only He knows to what extent people have been inspired by it," Seigler said. A limited number of tickets will be sold and are for sale at $35 each. Proceeds from this event will be earmarked for Joined Artists, Musicians & Singers, Inc. (JAMS) future arts promotions.
